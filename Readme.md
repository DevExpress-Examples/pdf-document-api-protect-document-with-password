# How to protect a PDF document with a password


This example shows how a PDF document can be protected using both the owner and user passwords.<br><br>A user password is used to protect opening a document. After a document is opened with the user password, a user has access to the document with the specified permissions.<br><br>To get full access to the document (permissions are not taken into account in this case), this document must be opened with the owner password.<br><br>The Universal Subscription or an additional Document Server Subscription is required to use this example in production code. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Subscriptions/">DevExpress Subscription</a> page for pricing information. <br><br><br>Â
